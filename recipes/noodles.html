    <h2>Description</h2>
    <pre>
Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, 
salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon 
juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, 
or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</pre>
